SummerHaven is considering an effort to design, launch, and manage a digital gold token.  This token would allow investors to initiate and maintain ownership of gold (and possibly other commodities) through use of a cryptographically secure entry on a digital ledger.  

The ledger will reside in a standard blockchain or something significantly similar. It may be distributed, or may have a singular instance.  It may be permissioned or  public.  The most likely platforms for the ledger are ERC20 and HyperLedger.

The purpose of the token would be investment (store of wealth) rather than a trading instrument.  The target investors would generally reside outside of the United States, in countries where the rule of law can not be trusted.  Subscriptions and redemptions of the token would be versus USD or Bitcoin.  A storage fee would be assessed to token holders, while transactions would be free.  For a negotiated delivery fee, holders of the token would be able to exchange it for physical gold for delivery at a wide range of globally distributed warehouses.  


After researching the landscape in which the proposed token would reside, considering the likely use cases for the proposed token, and determining the unique skills, capabilities, and strengths we could apply to the project, I'm left with these serious concerns about the impact of pursuing a digital gold token on SummerHaven's welfare.

\textbf{Viability of a Digital Gold Token:}

\begin{description}[font=$\bullet$~\normalfont\scshape\color{red!50!black}]
\item [Liquidity] Digital tokens can bring trading liquidity to otherwise illiquid assets.  Gold is already a highly liquid asset, and the proposed token would have less liquidity than existing markets. 
\item [KYC/AML] If these checks are only done on subscriptions and redemptions, we risk creating a vehicle for unacceptable transactions, and bringing regulatory or legal action on SummerHaven
\item [Efficiency / Cost] Digital tokens can make inefficient (expensive) asset transactions more efficient.  Gold markets are already somewhat to highly efficient.
\item [Fractional Ownership] Digital tokens enable fractional ownership of very large assets.  The benefit wouldn't apply to gold.
\item [Unclear and Changing Regulatory Environment] While it may be possible to get comfortable with the current regulatory and legal environment for digital tokens in all applicable countries, these frameworks will continue to be highly fluid, unpredictably making something acceptable become unacceptable.

\textbf{Ability of SummerHaven to Successfully Launch a Digital Gold Token:}

\begin{description}[font=$\bullet$~\normalfont\scshape\color{blue!50!black}]
\item [Lack Blockchain Expertise] yellow and banana shaped
\item [Lack Distribution Platform] red and round
\item [Lack Investment Capital] orange and round
\item [Lack Personnel (distraction)] yellow, kinda round
\item [Crowded with Competitors that are in Gold Business] needs cleaned up
